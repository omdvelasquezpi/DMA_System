Emotions Identification KNN Classifier 

This repository presents the development of a basic algorithm for emotion recognition based on a neural network model with KNN classifier trained with the FER-2013 database. (https://www.kaggle.com/msambare/fer2013)

The repository consists of a NN_Training.py file that runs the training of the classifier model and exports it to a .sav file. 
The Clas_Emotions.py executable loads the KNN classifier model and uses it to perform the classification of emotions through the webcam of the computer used.
